Lesson 1: Printing Strings

Printing a string in quite simple. 

First, create a variable. Let's say, in this case, the word, message:

message 

Next, assign a value to the variable using equal sign or = 

message=

Now, place a string (or a set of numbers, letters, symbols, spaces) in quotation marks--whatever you want to tell the world: 

message= "Hello, LinkedIn!"

And last but not least, use the print function or action to tell Python to print the string:

message= "Hello, LinkedIn!"
print (message)

You should get the following message back from your program

Hello, LinkedIn!

And there you have it. You (or me?) are one step closer to becoming a programmer, system administrator, etc ! =)
