Lesson 2: Pound Signs 

Following our previous lesson, we will be taking our previously created code:

message = "Hello, LinkedIn!" 
print (message) 

and adding small notes to it using the pound sign or # sign. 

These pound signs or hash tags serve as demarcations to let anyone reading code what the code does or what section of your code might need a little work, without having any effect on the code itself:

hashtag#PringtingStrings. 
hashtag#Actually, this code might need a little work. Can you please make the string or set of strings a little longer please? Thanks. 

message = "Hello, LinkedIn!" 
print (message) 

Now, you try to add pound signs to this or another project you are creating
